# thing_counter

## Planning

- [x] Users should be able to count stuff
- [x] Users should be able to register new things that they want to count
- [x] Users should have an "unlimited" number of things that they can count
- [] Counts and things should persist between sessions
- [] Should not connect to the internet
- [] We want to be able to delete things
- [?] We want to be able to decrement as well
- [] We want to be able to see historical counts
- [] There should be a simple onboarding explaining how to create things and how to count
- [] There should be a simple screen where I can count wherever I tap
